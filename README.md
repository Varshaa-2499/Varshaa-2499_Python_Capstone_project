## Nykaa Cosmetics — Python Data Analysis

### Overview
This project explores the Nykaa cosmetics dataset to uncover patterns in pricing, ratings, reviews, brands, and categories. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, visualizations, text analysis (optional), and a simple model (e.g., rating bucket or price-tier prediction). The goal is to convert raw data into actionable insights for assortment, pricing, and marketing.

🔹 Objectives

* Standardize and clean product/review data (brand, category, price, ratings, reviews).

* Analyzeed price distribution, rating patterns, and top brands/categories.

* Identified best-value products (high rating, low price).

* Mine review sentiment and keywords that drive satisfaction.

* Build a small predictive model (classification/regression).


🔹 Key Visuals

* Price vs Rating value quadrant.

* Top brands/categories by SKUs and by rating_count

* Box plots: price by category, rating by brand

* Word clouds / top n-grams: positive vs negative reviews (optional)

* Confusion matrix (if you built a model)


🔹 Insights:

* Mid-range lipsticks have the highest median ratings and strong review volume.

* ~70% of top-rated SKUs concentrate in a handful of brands.

* Reviews with “lightweight”/“non-sticky” skew positive; “drying” skews negative.

* Discounts >20% correlate with higher review counts, with diminishing returns after ~40%.
